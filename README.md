# Power BI dashboard - Employee Deployment Metrics
## Overview 

This Power BI dashboard presents an in-depth analysis of the HR dataset, focusing on various deployment metrics related to employees. The dashboard utilizes the SQL queries provided earlier to derive insightful visualizations on different aspects such as average length of employment, gender distribution, distribution by location, race distribution, distribution across states, age group by gender distribution, department by termination rates, and age group distribution.

## Key Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

1. Average Length of Employment:

Visualizes the average length of employment in years for all employees. This provides an overview of employee tenure within the organization.

2. Gender Distribution:

Displays the distribution of employees by gender using a pie chart. It offers an understanding of the gender composition of the workforce.

3. Distribution by Location:

Represents the distribution of employees across various locations, indicating the number of employees in each location.

4. Race Distribution:

Illustrates the racial or ethnic distribution of employees using a bar chart. This provides insights into the diversity of the workforce.

5. Distribution across States:

Displays the distribution of employees across different states, showcasing the geographical spread of the workforce.

6. Age Group by Gender Distribution:

Shows the distribution of employees across different age groups, segmented by gender. This helps identify age-related trends based on gender.

7. Department by Termination Rates:

Provides a bar chart showing the termination rates in each department. This helps identify departments with higher turnover rates.

8. Age Group Distribution:

Visualizes the distribution of employees across age groups using a histogram. This provides a clear picture of the age demographics of the workforce.
